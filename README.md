## Hi there, I'm Manikandan Balasubramanian
DevOps for AI/ML @[ZOHO Corp](https://www.zoho.com/)
 
## About Me

As an AI cybersecurity Engineer,  I'm responsible for AI security strategy and defining the best-in-class cybersec standards for our AI platform and the AI solutions built on top of it.

I started my career as a DevOps developer and I encountered problems in deploying, managing, and scaling ML/DL applications. I gathered experience with cloud design patterns, where I focused on the containerization of applications to minimize the variation in the runtime environment in different deployments. 
Later as a Security and Privacy coordinator, I concentrated on privacy and compliance aspects of the ML/DL applications.
